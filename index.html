        The Uyghur people are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group originating from and culturally affiliated with Central/East Asia,
        with a total population of about 14 million people.
        They are recognized as native to the Xinjiang region in Northwest China.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Their culture is extremely unique, and much of it stems from a beautiful combination of cultures from Central and East Asia,
        Eastern Europe, the Turkish region, and so on.

        However, it's been estimated that since 2015 at least a million Uyghurs have been detained in internment camps in Xinjiang.
        While these camps are officially labelled "Vocational Education and Training Centers",
        it's been claimed that these camps serve to bleach the Uyghurs of their culture and religion,
        with conditions lower than that of prison standards. These people are being tortured, raped,
        and there are even reports that their organs are ripped out and harvested for money.

        The more is learned about the atrocity, the more it becomes similar to the tragedy that is the Holocaust,
        and the other genocides that came after and were not stopped.
        And since the United Nations is being hesitant about acting on this situation,
        it's important that more people are aware about this crisis so that there is a greater voice calling for the Uyghur people to be freed.
